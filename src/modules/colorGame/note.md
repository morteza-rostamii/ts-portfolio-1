==============================

# how hex works?
==

# 6 digits
# red, green, blue
# base 16 digits 

# 0 to 9
# A to F =: 10 to 15

# A = 10
# B = 11

First two digits: Red intensity (00-FF, where FF is maximum)
Second two digits: Green intensity (00-FF)
Last two digits: Blue intensity (00-FF)

#FF0000

# short hand
#F00 is equivalent to #FF0000 as both represent pure red.
